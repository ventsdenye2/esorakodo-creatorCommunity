/**
* Module-shaped wrapper around vinext's built-in default not-found component.
* Used as the fallback when an app does not define its own `app/not-found.tsx`
* (and has not opted into `app/global-not-found.tsx`). The runtime treats any
* `{ default: Component }` record as a "not-found module", so wrapping the
* component this way lets us thread the default through the existing
* `rootNotFoundModule` plumbing without introducing a parallel code path.
*
* Mirrors Next.js's `defaultNotFoundPath`
* (`next/dist/client/components/builtin/not-found.js`), which is selected
* automatically when the user has not supplied a custom not-found file:
* https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/build/webpack/loaders/next-app-loader/index.ts
