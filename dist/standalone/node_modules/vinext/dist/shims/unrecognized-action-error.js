/**
* Unrecognized server-action errors.
*
* When a server action call fails because the server did not recognize the
* action id, the client bundle and the server are typically from different
* deployments and a hard reload is required.
*
* This module is intentionally dependency-free: both the `next/navigation`
* shim (which re-exports these for user code) and vinext's client
* server-action dispatcher import `UnrecognizedActionError` from here, so the
* `instanceof` check inside `unstable_isUnrecognizedActionError` resolves
* against a single shared class.
*
* Ported 1:1 from Next.js:
*   https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/client/components/unrecognized-action-error.ts
