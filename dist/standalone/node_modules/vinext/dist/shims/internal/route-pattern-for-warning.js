/**
* Side-effect-free accessor for the current render's route pattern, used by
* Next.js-parity diagnostics such as the Link shim's
* "Invalid href ... in page: '...'" `console.error`.
*
* Mirrors Next.js's `router.pathname`, which is the *route pattern* (e.g.
* `/posts/[id]`), not the resolved URL. During Pages Router SSR the route
* pattern lives on the request-scoped SSR context; the server-only
* `router-state.ts` publishes an accessor for it under a well-known
* `Symbol.for` handle. We read it through that handle rather than importing
* `router.ts` directly — importing `router.ts` would pull its browser-only
* `installWindowNext()` side effect into every consumer of the Link shim
* (including the App Router client bundle), clobbering `window.next.router`.
*
* On the client (or when no accessor is registered, e.g. App Router) we fall
* back to `window.location.pathname`, then to `"/"`.
